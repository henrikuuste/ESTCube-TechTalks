# Fastware

“Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster” - Niklaus Wirth

- What does it take to write fast code?
  - Special languages? Assembly anyone?
  - Advanced algorithms?
  - Bare metal optimizations?
  - Complex compiler flags?
- What is efficiency and how do we become more efficient?
- What is performance and how do we perform better?


We'll be going deep into hardware architecture and how it should affect your coding.
As well as common efficiency issues and concepts in production code.
We will also touch on benchmarking and profiling.

Loosely based on my Master's seminar talk, but much more in-depth on the
hardware optimization side most likely. Also a lot more code examples and the like.

PS. Title stolen from Andrei Alexandrescu, who _stole_ it from Scott Meyers

## Organization

No specific language knowledge is required, but software development experience helps a lot.
