# Deeply embedded in the battle for C++ (1983-present) 

- Can we use C++ in embedded development? _(hint: yes)_
- What are the tools?
- How does it compare to other options?
- How do we get negative overhead? _(hint: magic)_
- How do exceptions compare to other error handling methods?
- Do we ever need RTTI?
- What about STL?

Real world benchmarking and code examples.
The benefits of static analysis.

## Organization

Knowledge of C and embedded systems is very good to have.
There will be quite a lot of code in this talk.

We'll be using a lot of https://godbolt.org/
