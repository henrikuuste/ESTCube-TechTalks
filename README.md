# The Pitch
**ESTCube TechTalks** is meant for people who like to learn and ask the tough questions. Like: 
* Why in the world would you …?
* What is this good for anyway?
* How the .. ?
* What in the … ?

And of course the classics:
* WTF?
* What does this button do?

If you want to discuss every cool idea you hear or if you want to share all the interesting things you do at work or in your spare time, then this is the place for you. We want active, experienced engineers to spend a relaxed afternoon together and discuss new techniques, crazy ideas and tough problems in various fields.

Expand your horizons into areas you have not touched before or go deep into topics where you are considered a guru. The main aim is to keep our knowledge on the cutting edge and facilitate the transfer of knowledge between people. 

With snacks of course ;)
