# ESTCube-1 and ESEO: lessons learned?

There has been a lot of talk about past mistakes and the lack of effect on current projects. However, all this has been fairly nebulous and somewhat focused on who to blame.

The aim of this talk is to put our engineering/scientific minds to work and approach the subject with a divide-and-conquer mentality. After all, most of all are scientists and should not really use words like __believe__ or __assume__. Nor should our actions and discussions be about feelings or being "triggered". So let's take the issues one at a time, look at the __facts__ and __analyze the causes, effects and possible solutions__ to the best of our ability.

## Organization

No specific knowledge is required, just a keen mind and a willingness to discuss mistakes and problems in a methodical way.

The talk can be held in a larger room, since the projector quality is not a huge issue. Comfort should still be kept in mind. And a fairly small enclosed group is still better for in-depth discussions without interruptions derailing things.
