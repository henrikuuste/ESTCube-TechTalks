## ESTCube-1 and ESEO: lessons learned?
<br>
ESTCube team, 2017

=======================================

### Organization

- Quick `overview` of the issues we thought of
- Gather `additional issues` from the attendees
- Highlight the `largest issues`
- `Discuss` the issues one by one in order of priority
  - Try to find some `solutions`
- **Profit**

=======================================

## A list of issues

----

### Management

- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">No dedicated **project managers**</span>

- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Crunch</span>
- <span style="color: #e68a8a; font-weight:bold;">Low student retention and utilization</span>
- <span style="color: #e68a8a; font-weight:bold;">Improper expert utilization</span>

### Management II: Revengeance

- <span style="color: #e68a8a; font-weight:bold;">No comfortable colocation space</span>
- Unrelated and charity tasks
- Inexperienced members do not discuss issues
- External partners
- University courses do not generally help

----

### Technical management

- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Lack of systematic testing</span>
- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Lack of in-depth reviews</span>
- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Crappy initial design reviews</span>
- Lack of novelty
- IT issues
- Parts going out of production during development
- Availability of manufacturing and testing facilities

----

### Funding

- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Lack of funding</span>
- <span style="color: #e68a8a; font-weight:bold;">Lack of basic equipment in the labs</span>
- Limited mechanical manufacturing capabilities
- Test equipment not in order
- Not enough usable models of final hardware
- Availability of "space grade" tools and consumables

----

### Technical

- <span style="color: #d95b43; font-weight:bold;">Over-engineering</span>
- Component organization
- Board versioning
- Prototype code becomes flight code
- Detailed logging of software __AND__ hardware bugs
- Not enough easily accessible test points
- Test the flux!

=======================================

## The big ones

----
### Lack of funding

- A crisis of __identity__
- Discuss most likely options
- Define `long term goals`

----

### Identity: Volunteer organization

- Beg for money (a lot of active fundraising people)
  - Generous donors
  - Sponsorships
  - Crowd sourcing
- Appropriate assets from other projects
  - Hope for ESA projects that are not too difficult
  - Write a lot of proposals
- Rely and the charity and interest of bright people

----
### Identity: Educational

  - Tight collaboration with universities
  - `Paid` teachers and supervisors
  - Mandatory courses that students can `fail`
  - Funding for tools and classes
  - Simple (low novelty and engineering complexity) goals
  - Long and uncertain deadlines

----
### Identity: Scientific

  - `Novel` ideas and `high scientific complexity`
  - Scientific funding
    - More `PhDs` and academic personnel
    - Writing lots of `papers` (extra time)
    - Attending lots of `conferences` (extra time and money)
  - Uncertain results
  - Longish deadlines
  - Low expert retention

----
### Identity: Business

  - Investments and ROI
    - A few MEUR is fairly easy
  - Requires a `good idea`
  - Very good `marketing`
  - Engineers able to deliver 50% of what marketing promised
    - `Competitive pay` with interesting goals

----
### No dedicated project management

- Day-to-day organization is a `full time job`
  - `Active` and `always available`
- ESTCube is large - multiple people
- **Common tasks:**
  - Task management and identification of project wide issues
  - Dealing with external parties
  - Write and review documentation
  - Project plan, budget, schedule and risk analysis
  - Babysitting *"difficult"* members

----

### Low student retention and utilization

- Stipends do not always work. The __reward__ has to be __proportional to effort__.
- EAP as a reward
- Required courses that students can fail
- Interesting tasks with active supervision
  - Investment into students should be chosen carefully
- Experts are "too professional"?

----

### Improper expert utilization

- Experts not working on things they actually have expertise in
  - Assigned to other tasks
  - Experts working on things "they would like to learn"
- Babysitting
- Burning out (more on that later)

----

### No comfortable colocation space

- Problems with TO
  - Commute time and availability
    - Huge issue for people with jobs or school
    - Equipment transport
  - Restricted access
  - Space in the labs
  - Too many public events
- Problems with Physicum
  - Space is too small with a bad layout
  - It's a mess and not presentable
  - Lack of equipment

----

### Crunch

- **Overtime always causes a loss of time later on**
- Tasks are not completed by the majority
  - Fall to the responsible minority
- The "we have plenty of time" and "last minute" mindset
- Vacations are always cut short or skipped
- Can not assign critical tasks to people who might not finish them
  - How many non-critical tasks do we have?
- Tight task management
- Proper sprints

----

### Core people are irreplaceable

----

### Lack of experienced people on the active teams

----

### Too many secondary projects and responsibilities

----

### Lack of systematic testing

- No separate testers
- No frameworks or infrastructure
- No profiling or benchmarking
- Lack of time

----

### Lack of in-depth reviews

- Lack of time
- Scheduling and colocation
- No built-in culture
- No review process

----

### Crappy initial design reviews

----

### Lack of basic equipment in the labs

----

### Over-engineering
