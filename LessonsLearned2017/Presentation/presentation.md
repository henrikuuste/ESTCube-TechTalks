## ESTCube-1 and ESEO: lessons learned?
<br>
ESTCube team, 2017

=======================================

### Organization

- Quick `overview` of the issues we thought of
- Gather `additional issues` from the attendees
- Highlight the `largest issues`
- `Discuss` the issues one by one in order of priority
  - Try to find some `solutions`
- **Profit**

=======================================

----

### Funding

----

### Technical

- Test the flux!

=======================================

# The big ones

----
## Lack of funding

- <span style="color: #e68a8a;">A crisis of __identity__</span>
- Discuss most likely options
- Define `long term goals`

----

### Identity: Volunteer organization

- Beg for money (a lot of active fundraising people)
  - Generous donors
  - Sponsorships
  - Crowd sourcing
- Appropriate assets from other projects
  - Hope for ESA projects that are not too difficult
  - Write a lot of proposals
- Rely and the charity and interest of bright people
  - `interesting` goals
  - `fun` working environment

----
### Identity: Educational

  - Tight collaboration with universities
  - `Paid` teachers and supervisors
  - Mandatory courses that students can `fail`
  - Funding for tools and classes
  - `Simple` goals
    - Low novelty and engineering complexity
  - Long and `uncertain deadlines`

----
### Identity: Scientific

  - `Novel` ideas and `high scientific complexity`
  - Scientific funding
    - More `PhDs` and academic personnel
    - Writing lots of `papers` (extra time)
    - Attending lots of `conferences` (extra time and money)
  - Uncertain results
  - Longish deadlines
  - Low expert retention

----
### Identity: Business

  - Investments and ROI
    - A few MEUR is fairly easy
    - Beyond that is more difficult
  - Requires a `good idea`
  - Very good `marketing`
  - Full time engineers
    - Deliver >50% of what marketing promised
    - `Competitive pay` with interesting goals

----
### No dedicated project management

- <span style="color: #e68a8a;">Day-to-day organization is a `full time job`</span>
  - `Active` and `always available`
- ESTCube is large - multiple people
- **Common tasks:**
  - Task management and identification large issues
  - Dealing with external parties
  - Write and review documentation
  - Project plan, budget, schedule and risk analysis
  - Babysitting *"difficult"* members
- <span style="color: #e68a8a;">Marketing and PR are **not** PM tasks!</span>

----

### Low student retention and utilization

- Stipends do not always work. The <span style="color: #e68a8a;">__reward__</span> has to be <span style="color: #e68a8a;">__proportional to effort__</span>.
- EAP as a reward
- Required courses that students can fail
- Interesting tasks with active supervision
  - Careful selection of students
- Experts are "too professional"?

----

### Improper expert utilization

- Experts not working on things they actually have expertise in
  - Assigned to other tasks
  - Experts working on things *they would like to learn*
- Fragmentation of responsibilities
- Babysitting
- Burning out (more on that later)
- Not enough experts to cover all teams
- Expert advice is `discarded`

----

### No comfortable colocation space

- __Problems with TO__
  - `Commute` time and availability
    - Huge issue for people with jobs or school
    - Equipment transport
  - Restricted access
  - Space in the labs
  - Too many public events
- __Problems with Physicum__
  - `Space` is too small with a bad layout
  - It's a mess and not presentable
  - Lack of equipment

----

### Crunch

- <span style="color: #e68a8a;">**Overtime always causes a loss of time later on**</span>
- Tasks are not completed by the majority
  - `Responsible minority`
- *"We have plenty of time"* and *"last minute"* mindset
- `Vacations` are always cut short or skipped
- Can not assign critical tasks to people who might not finish them
  - How many non-critical tasks do we have?
- Tight task management
- Proper sprints

----

### Core people are irreplaceable

- Limited sharing of knowledge
- High disparity between skill sets and levels
- Leaving is a very hard decision
- Duplication of responsibilities
  - Lack of time and resources
- In-depth reviews would help

----

### Too many secondary projects and responsibilities

- All the proposals!
  - Hope none of them get accepted...
- Funding has to come from somewhere
- Pointless courses at school
- Supervising/mentoring with no reward
- Writing articles about nothing
- Hey! Want to make a start-up?

----

### Lack of systematic testing

- No separate testers
- No frameworks or infrastructure
- No profiling or benchmarking
- Lack of time

----

### Lack of in-depth reviews

- Lack of time
- Scheduling and colocation
- No built-in culture
- No review process

----

### Crappy initial design reviews

- Not enough time allocated for preliminary design
- No structured discussions with the core team
- Leads to huge issues later in the project

----

### Lack of basic equipment in the labs

- Nuts, bolts, cleaning supplies, connectors, cables, ...
- Covering costs can be difficult
  - Stocking significant quantities of things that are not immediately needed
  - Some things can be fairly costly
- Allocate regular funds for this purpose
- Assign people to deal with acquisition and organization

----

### Over-engineering

- Lack of experience and knowledge
- The "cool" factor
- Re-inventing the wheel, fire, spoken and written language
